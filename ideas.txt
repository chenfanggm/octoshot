Requirements:

* 3d
* Immersive landscape
* Simple mechanic

* Starts outside in the rain & heavy fog, need to find glowing butterflies
* These butterflies give you messages guiding you to the next goal
* The land has been cursed with rain forever, and it's your job to reverse the curse

* Write a weather system that runs by a few basic rules
* The user must figure these rules out and "program" a correct dimension where the
  weather shines
* You can backtrack out of a dimension if you make a mistake, but its costly and hard
  (only do it every now and then, or just make it take a lot of time?)

Variations of bad weather:
* All rain (what you begin with)
* Rain & Lightning (kills)
* Rain upside-down
* Rain sideways
* Lightning sideways (kills)
* Hail
* Bad soil (producing flooding, possibly an ocean?)
* Heavy fog
* Patchy rain/fog/any of the above

* How does the player "code" the weather, how to make it fun?
* Make a grid and he/she can place objects to change it, like a puzzle?
** That might get boring, basically just a 2d puzzle

Idea #2: DIMENSIONAL IDENTITY CRISIS
* An event occurred that messed up spacetime, and the current dimension is
  freaking out
* The weather indicates how "correct" the dimension is
* The dimension is randomly forked itself into multiple ones with minor
  differences to try to fix itself
* You must restore the dimension to its original state and to calm it down!

But how?

* Probably should do this in 2d.. not sure where I'll get 3d models from
* Collect pieces and put them back in the right place
* Enemies around the board?
